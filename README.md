Welcome to the Retinal OCT Analysis Platform**

Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a powerful imaging technique that provides high-resolution cross-sectional images of the retina, allowing for early detection and monitoring of various retinal diseases. Each year, over 30 million OCT scans are performed, aiding in the diagnosis and management of eye conditions that can lead to vision loss, such as choroidal neovascularization (CNV), diabetic macular edema (DME), and age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

Why OCT Matters OCT is a crucial tool in ophthalmology, offering non-invasive imaging to detect retinal abnormalities. On this platform, we aim to streamline the analysis and interpretation of these scans, reducing the time burden on medical professionals and increasing diagnostic accuracy through advanced automated analysis.

Key Features of the Platform

Automated Image Analysis: Our platform uses state-of-the-art machine learning models to classify OCT images into distinct categories: Normal, CNV, DME, and Drusen.
Cross-Sectional Retinal Imaging: Examine high-quality images showcasing both normal retinas and various pathologies, helping doctors make informed clinical decisions.
Streamlined Workflow: Upload, analyze, and review OCT scans in a few easy steps.
Understanding Retinal Diseases through OCT

Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV)

Neovascular membrane with subretinal fluid
Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)

Retinal thickening with intraretinal fluid
Drusen (Early AMD)

Presence of multiple drusen deposits
Normal Retina

Preserved foveal contour, absence of fluid or edema
About the Dataset

Our dataset consists of 84,495 high-resolution OCT images (JPEG format) organized into train, test, and validation sets, split into four primary categories:

Normal
CNV
DME
Drusen
Each image has undergone multiple layers of expert verification to ensure accuracy in disease classification. The images were obtained from various renowned medical centers worldwide and span across a diverse patient population, ensuring comprehensive coverage of different retinal conditions.
